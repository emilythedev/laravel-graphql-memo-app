# Category Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive category functionality to the Laravel GraphQL TODO application as requested in the Epic. Categories are optional and include default Japanese categories.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `categories` table with:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name` (unique category name)
  - `color` (optional color for UI display)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` timestamps

- Updated `todos` table with:
  - `category_id` (nullable foreign key to categories)
  - Proper indexes for performance

### 2. Backend (Laravel)
- **Category Model**: Full Eloquent model with relationship to todos
- **Todo Model**: Updated to include category relationship
- **GraphQL Schema**: 
  - Category type with all fields
  - Updated Todo type to include optional category
  - Category queries (list all, get by ID)
  - Category mutations (create, update, delete)
  - Updated todo queries/mutations to support category_id
- **CategoryResolver**: Full CRUD operations for categories
- **TodoResolver**: Updated to support category filtering and CRUD
- **Seeding**: CategorySeeder with default Japanese categories

### 3. Frontend (React TypeScript)
- **Types**: Updated TypeScript interfaces for Category and Todo
- **GraphQL Queries/Mutations**: Updated to include category fields
- **TodoForm**: Added category dropdown selection (optional)
- **TodoList**: 
  - Category display with colored chips
  - Category filtering in filter controls
  - Responsive grid layout for all filters
- **UI/UX**: Consistent Material-UI design with existing app

## Default Categories
1. 仕事 (Work) - Blue (#1976d2)
2. プライベート (Private) - Green (#388e3c)
3. 勉強 (Study) - Orange (#f57c00)
4. 買い物 (Shopping) - Red (#d32f2f)
5. その他 (Other) - Purple (#7b1fa2)

## Usage
- Categories are **optional** - TODOs can be created without selecting a category
- Users can filter TODOs by category using the filter dropdown
- Categories are displayed as colored chips in the TODO list
- Category selection is available in both create and edit forms

## Technical Notes
- All changes follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintains backward compatibility (existing TODOs without categories work fine)
- Proper database constraints and relationships
- Responsive UI design matches existing app style
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
